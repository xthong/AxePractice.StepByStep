         * all the definitions for instantiation as well as lifetime managing. Now,
         * let's forget about lifetime management.
         * 
         * ContainerBuilder however, has no idea how to create an instance. So it is
         * the users' job (func). We just store the procedure and call it when needed.
         * 
         * You can add non-public member functions or member variables as you like.
